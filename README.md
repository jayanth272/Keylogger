# KeyLogger
`
In this project, we have developed a keylogger and a detection mechanism.
`
## Building KeyLogger
```
Keylogger is developed using python-scripts usage of MIME,pynput modules.
```
## Detecting KeyLogger
```
1.Detection mechanism is done by capturing the destination ip addresses of the mail packets sent from the machine.
2.Analyse the frequency of packets.
3.If the frequency of particular ip-address exceeds the threshold then an alert message is displayed to user.
